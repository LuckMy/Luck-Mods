#These are the mods required to access my Minecraft server
Tutorial to install Forge:
1.) Download the version listed in the Repo
2.) Open the file like any other
3.) Click Client Installation, not server, and let it work it's magic.

Mod installation:
1.)Browse to C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods
2.) Place all required mods into the mods folder

Starting Minecraft:
1.) Open it up
2.) Select the Forge profile
  2.A) I reccommend changing the amount of RAM available for Forge. You can do so by clicking "Launch Options", toggling advanced settings on, click forge, toggle JVM arguments on, edit the 2G to 6 or so. Don't go above half your total system RAM, click save
3.) Launch Minecraft
